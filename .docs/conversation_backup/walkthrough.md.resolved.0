## Verification Steps

### 1. Start the Application

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 2. Verify Authentication
1. Click "Sign In" in the Navbar.
2. Enter any email (e.g., `test@example.com`) and password.
3. Since we are in Dev mode with auto-registration, you should be redirected to the home page.
4. Verify that your email and role (EMPLOYEE) are displayed in the Navbar.
5. Click "Sign Out" to verify logout.

### 3. Database Verification
You can inspect the SQLite database to see the created user:
